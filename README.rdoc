Rails 3.1 app built w/ Twitter Bootstrap

This is my first rails app. It is designed to be a public sign-up/volunteer board. It was originally built for a church. It is designed to integrate online and offline sign ups because the main view is designed to be printed and hung on a wall where people in meatspace can write their name in the box next to the "slot".
